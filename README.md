## Installation

### Chrome

Cookie Refuser is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-refuser/mcglfjkmfeliffphgmihihlgehcfbkmi) — the easiest way to install it. You can also install it manually for free:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/leshyabracaglia/Cookie-refuser.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the cloned `Cookie-refuser` folder

### Firefox

Cookie Refuser is available on the [Firefox Add-ons marketplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-refuser/) — the easiest way to install it. You can also install it manually for free:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/leshyabracaglia/Cookie-refuser.git
   ```
2. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**
4. Select the `manifest.json` file inside the cloned `Cookie-refuser` folder

### Safari (macOS)

Cookie Refuser is available on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cookie-refuser/id6760318624?mt=12) — the easiest way to install it for Safari. You can also build it manually:

1. Clone the repository and ensure you have Xcode installed
2. Run Apple's converter from the terminal:
   ```
   xcrun safari-web-extension-converter /path/to/Cookie-refuser
   ```
3. Open the generated Xcode project and build it
4. Enable the extension in **Safari > Preferences > Extensions**

### iOS / iPadOS

Requires Xcode 14+ on macOS and an iOS 15+ or iPadOS 15+ device.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/leshyabracaglia/Cookie-refuser.git
   ```
2. Run the iOS build script:
   ```
   cd Cookie-refuser/ios
   ./build.sh
   ```
3. Open the generated `CookieRefuser.xcodeproj` in Xcode
4. Select your development team under **Signing & Capabilities** for both the app and extension targets
5. Build and run on your device (or simulator)
6. On your device, go to **Settings > Safari > Extensions** and enable **Cookie Refuser**
7. When prompted, allow the extension for **All Websites** or select specific sites

## Usage

- **Browse normally** — the extension runs on every page and automatically dismisses cookie banners
- **Click the extension icon** to open the popup where you can:
  - Toggle the extension on or off
  - See how many cookie banners have been denied
- The extension works in all frames (including iframes) so embedded consent dialogs are handled too

## How It Works

The content script uses a three-tier detection strategy:

1. **Known selectors** — Matches deny/reject buttons from popular consent platforms using platform-specific CSS selectors
2. **Banner search** — Locates cookie banner containers on the page and scans for deny/reject buttons inside them
3. **Broad search** — Falls back to scanning all interactive elements, scoring them by relevance to cookie consent context

If the banner hasn't appeared yet, the script retries periodically and also observes DOM mutations to catch dynamically injected banners.

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser        | Minimum Version | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Chrome         | 88+            | Full Manifest V3 support |
| Firefox        | 109+           | Manifest V3 with `browser_specific_settings` |
| Safari (macOS) | 15.4+          | Requires Xcode conversion |
| Safari (iOS)   | 15+            | Via iOS Safari Web Extension |

## Building

Install dependencies first:
```
npm install
```

Then build the extension packages:

```
# Build both Chrome and Firefox zips
npm run build

# Build Chrome only
npm run build:chrome

# Build Firefox only
npm run build:firefox
```

This generates `cookie-refuser-chrome.zip` and `cookie-refuser-firefox.zip` in the project root, ready to upload to the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons marketplace respectively.
